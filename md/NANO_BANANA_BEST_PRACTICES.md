# Nano Banana Pro Prompting Best Practices

To elevate results from good to great, the Prompt Engineering Agent must incorporate these professional strategies into the workflow.

## 1. Be Hyper-Specific
- **Do not** use vague descriptions like "fantasy armor".
- **Do** provide detailed descriptions: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
- **Rule**: The more detail provided, the more control we have.

## 2. Provide Context and Intent
- Explain the **purpose** of the image. The model's understanding of context influences the output.
- **Example**: "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" yields better results than just "Create a logo".

## 3. Iterate and Refine
- Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use the conversational nature to make small changes.
- **Examples**:
  - "That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?"
  - "Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious."

## 4. Use Step-by-Step Instructions
- For complex scenes, break the prompt into steps.
- **Structure**:
  1. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn."
  2. "Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar."
  3. "Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."

## 5. Use "Semantic Negative Prompts"
- **Avoid** saying "no cars".
- **Do** describe the desired scene positively to exclude elements.
- **Example**: Instead of "no cars", say "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."

## 6. Control the Camera
- Use photographic and cinematic language to control composition.
- **Keywords**: `wide-angle shot`, `macro shot`, `low-angle perspective`, `cinematic lighting`, `depth of field`.
